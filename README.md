## Project 3: OTP Authentication
**Description:**
The OTP Authentication project provides a secure and efficient user authentication solution by generating unique, time-sensitive one-time passwords (OTPs) for each login attempt. These OTPs are sent via email or SMS, ensuring that only the intended user can access the system. This additional layer of security protects against unauthorized access and enhances overall system security. The project focuses on reliability, ease of use, and robust security measures, making it a valuable tool for modern authentication needs.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OTP generation and validation libraries
- **APIs:** Twilio (for SMS OTP), Nodemailer (for Email OTP)
- **Others:** Git (Version Control), Postman (API testing)


## Project 4: RockPaperScissor
**Description:**
The Rock-Paper-Scissors project is a fun game implementation where players choose between rock, paper, or scissors, competing against the computer's randomized choice.

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **Others: Git (Version Control)**


## Project 5: DrumKit
**Description:**
The Drum Kit project is an interactive web application where users can play various drum sounds by clicking on corresponding buttons or using keyboard keys.

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**
- **Others:** Git (Version Control)

## Project 6: Task Manager
**Description:**  
The Task Manager app is a backend system for efficient task management. It allows users to create, assign, track, and prioritize tasks securely with JWT-based authentication. Developed using Node.js and Express.js, the app utilizes MongoDB for data storage. Git ensures version control, while Postman validates API functionality. This solution streamlines task management, promoting productivity in a reliable and user-friendly platform.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Axios
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Others:** Git (Version Control), Postman (API testing)

## Project 7: JWT Token

**Description:**  
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe method for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Others:** Git (Version Control)
