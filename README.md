## Project 3: OTP Authentication
**Description:**
The OTP Authentication project provides a secure and efficient user authentication solution by generating unique, time-sensitive one-time passwords (OTPs) for each login attempt. These OTPs are sent via email or SMS, ensuring that only the intended user can access the system. This additional layer of security protects against unauthorized access and enhances overall system security. The project focuses on reliability, ease of use, and robust security measures, making it a valuable tool for modern authentication needs.

Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OTP generation and validation libraries
APIs: Twilio (for SMS OTP), Nodemailer (for Email OTP)
Others: Git (Version Control), Postman (API testing)
